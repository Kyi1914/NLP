## Overview of this assignment

In this assignment, I will create a resume parser.  
Users will upload their resume in PDF format, and the system will output the contact information, a list of unique skills, education details and orgnization in order.

## Task 1: Implementation Foundation
I extend the resume parser code based on the spaCy class using the Resume Parsing.ipynb and implement additional features or improvements inspired by spaCyâ€™s capabilities in natural language
processing.

## Task 2: Resume Parsing Features - Web Application Development
I develop a simple web application that showcases the capabilities of extraction.
